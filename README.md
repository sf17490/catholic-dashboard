# :pray: Catholic Data Dashboard :pray:

The Catholic Data Dashboard is a dashboard measuring the Catholic Church's impact on England & Wales.

In particular, it displays data and trends concerning the church's success in ministering the sacraments.

It helps answer questions such as:

- How many people are attending Mass?
- Which dioceses are best at converting people?
- Is the Catholic Church growing or shrinking in England & Wales?

It seeks to answer questions like these in an easy-to-understand way.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
